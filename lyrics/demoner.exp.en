Dieter Meyer's Institution is the arena for most of the material on Maestro. It is a place that, under the cover of being a mental institution specializing in war trauma, is involved in shady activities like drug dealing, whitewashing of money, as well as selling organs to wealthy private hospitals. The institution is built up and run by a mysterious figure who no one knows the identity of. He is referred to as Meyer, Maestro, and Papa among others, but no one has ever seen him. The protagonist in these lyrics has been confined to Dieter Meyer for life with the diagnosis of incurable paranoia. Really, he is just an ordinary man who has discovered what goes on in this place and has therefore been committed and subdued. After a few years hospitalized, he has realized that he is alone in the fight against the corrupt system, and now only wishes to end it all with hope of better times in heaven.

"VÃ¥re demoner" is one of several "genre songs", this time in surf/rockabilly tradition. We tend to say that we like the best of all genres and use the inspiration actively. Sometimes the result is a bit more clearly genre than other times. It is usually these songs we like the least of our own material, and so they often fall to the wayside. In the rehearsal phase for this album we tried to "Kaizer-ify" several of these songs, including this one, but we found out it was both livelier, more fun to play, and also better if we instead genre-ified them.
