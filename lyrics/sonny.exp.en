With the Evig Pint album we wanted to show a slightly different side of ourselves than we had on Ompa til du dør, and show that we weren't just a party band with only one gear that had gotten lucky. Therefore, we did away with some of the song ideas that leaned in the direction of ompa in favor of heavier and darker rock songs. So in came "Di grind", "De involverte", "Salt & pepper", and out went "Kavalér" and this one, "Du og meg Sonny", a romantic nostalgic song in waltz time. This song is actually one of the reasons we wanted to do this rarities album. We think it is so good that it would be simply terrible of us not to share it with Kaizer-sympathizers out there.<br/>

Lyrically, "Sonny" is tied to "De involverte". The narrator has been high up in the mafia, and is actually the boss Sonny's right hand on the outside. Sonny now sits inside, condemned to death ("Drøm hardt"), but controls things on the outside from the prison through his right hand man, who in this song reminisces about the past. He has gotten sentimental in his blind, older days, recalls the good, old times, and now only prepares himself to die.
