In the year 2000 there was naturally no one who had heard of the newly-founded band Kaizers Orchestra. The few who had heard of it had little faith that it would ever get anywhere, and no one could really blame them for that.

BUT, Janove had other plans, and in addition to talking a lot about these bright outlooks, he also made a song about them, a sort of pep-talk for the band. In short, Prosessen is about Kaizers' future "rise to fame" as he imagined it. "The revolution" and "the new religion" are Kaizers, who contribute to saving the music world from the mire we thought the industry was in at the time. The new homemade apricot wine, if you will. The main problem with Prosessen, and the reason it wasn't on Ompa, was that it was a little too pop-catchy. We were terrified of getting a "hit" we couldn't completely stand up for, end up in the DH-rock category, and come off the ski jump askew in what could have been a great musical flight. We felt that the melody went off like a gunshot, but unfortunately a gunshot of the irritating sort. If we were presented and associated with this song, the rest of the album would simply not be in keeping with it. So for the sake of the whole we dropped the frivolous "Prosessen" in favor of dark Romani style, which is what we were really passionate about. We did the right thing with that, with the future taken into consideration.

A fun fact to end with: Author and Kaizer friend Tore Renberg heard Prosessen in concert once at Bl√• in 2000 and has been humming the catchy/irritating tune ever since. So here you finally have it, Tore, you're welcome!
