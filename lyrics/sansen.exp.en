This is yet another example of what we call a "genre song", in this case a blues rock song. Even though we like a lot of music in this genre ourselves, we think it is difficult to find our place in it. That is the main reason that "Den sjette sansen" was cut from the Maskineri album.<br/>
<br/>
Like "Medisin & Psykiatri", this is also a song we have played quite a few times live. Therefore, we have gotten a number of inquiries about whether it will be released, and finally we have found a place for it.<br/>
<br/>
The lyrics are a sort of surrealist reflection over a life lived so far, and what one eventually could do differently if one got a second chance. Like the other lyrics on Maskineri, it is not a part of a conceptual story but uses themes we often engage with: the big questions in life, and life after death. Nothing less.
