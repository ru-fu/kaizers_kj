We tend to be in agreement on which songs are good enough to wager on, we are quite compatible like that, but there was a bit of disagreement about this one. Some felt that the "doomsday country" quota had been filled up with Hevnervals from Evig Pint, while others thought it was an up-tempo breath of fresh air that there absolutely was room for on Maestro. As we know, the benefit of the doubt was never given to the innocent this time, and "Medisin & Psykiatri" remained unrecorded.<br/>
<br/>
It has been performed live a number of times, and on the last round we did it, fall 2008, we had worked out a new and improved arrangement with the solo theme as a pompous intro. We felt that elevated the song and made it ripe for a proper recording.<br/>

Vicente is the protagonist in these lyrics, the same man who in "På ditt skift" manages to escape from Dieter Meyer's Inst. Vicente is not sick in ways other than being rebellious, and in "Medisin & Psykiatri" he plans what he later succeeds in on "På ditt skift", namely to be the first to run away from DMI, and on the boss's shift at that.<br/>
<br/>
The story of Vicente continues on the Maestro song "Delikatessen" where he, as a free man, describes Delikatessen as the worst ward in DMI. Additionally, it is documents from here that he is later stopped with on the way to Poland in the song "Die Polizei".
