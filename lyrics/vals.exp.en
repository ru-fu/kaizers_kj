"Stormfull vals" was on the list of songs to go on the Ompa album, but was beat out in the last stage of composition by newcomers Kontroll p√• Kontinentet and 170 (Janove has always had a tendency to come up with the best album tracks right before the deadline. For example, Evig Pint was the last song to be made for that album, and Maestro was the last song for its album). "Stormfull vals" is a real rattler, one of the first we made as Kaizers Orchestra, and it's not a waltz either. It is about Egil Ei, who after foreseeing the great flood in the song "Katastrofen" - without being believed - turns to the bottle for comfort.<br/>

The village, and specifically his great love Ms. Victoria Zudine, are (seemingly) taken by the flood, the wind rages on, and it is stormy both inside Egil's head and outside. Humorous tragedy is something we have dealt with many times in our lyrics, yes, and here as well. This song is also a genre song, and we found out the only way to do it was to get drunk on Terje's Christmas present, a 23 year old rum from Cuba, invite everyone we knew with an instrument into the big room in the studio, count to four, stumble away and hope for the best.
