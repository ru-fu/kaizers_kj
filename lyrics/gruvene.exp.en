Lyrically, this song is most closely related to the more famous "Bøn fra helvete". The mines on 16 are the place described as a hell on earth, the place that it's no use to pray from.<br/>
<br/>
The story is about the sailor Marcelo Conradas who, after being captured in a raid somewhere in Asia, is sold as a slave to gold miners. From "the bars at Kringsjå" he describes the ruthless and psychopathic Henry who torments and tortures the mine workers until it all culminates in commotion and mutiny.<br/>
<br/>
In the following chaos and escape attempt, Marcelo is the only one who comes out alive, with a bag of gold in his sack. In safety, the thought of revenge is so strong that he later spends his whole fortune on having it realized. In "Marcelos leksjon", another unreleased song that is not in this collection, he learns voodoo in Egypt (from a certain Mr. Kaizer) and finally gets his revenge on Henry by letting the world's heaviest Siamese cat eat the head of the voodoo doll that represents Henry (and people ask us what we are inspired by when we write lyrics…!)<br/>

Musically, "Gruvene på 16" was considered too "ballad-like" for the Ompa album. It had too much of the precursor to Kaizers "gnom" in it, we thought, and was therefore not "fresh" and hard-hitting enough. Now, however, we have grown up and are no longer afraid to admit that we also very much love nice ballads.
